# Design rules

This is the single design reference for wherdr interface changes. Follow the
existing app rather than introducing a second visual system. Source examples below
are in [main.css](../app/assets/css/main.css), unless linked separately.

## Structure and typography

Keep the brutalist herdr.dev style: square corners and thin, 1 px rules separating
surfaces. Use the existing font tokens: Archivo for display headings (`--display`),
Inter for body text (`--sans`), and JetBrains Mono for technical text and labels
(`--mono`). Labels are uppercase mono, with the existing letter spacing; do not
uppercase body copy. Examples: `.hw-sheet-title`, `.menu-group`, `.task-chip` and
the `--font-display`, `--font-sans`, `--font-mono` definitions.

## Theme colors

Use theme variables only in interface styling: `--text`, `--text-2`, `--muted`,
`--dim`, `--line`, `--line-soft`, `--accent`, `--on-accent`, `--bg`, `--surface`
and the semantic state tokens. Do not add hardcoded hex, RGB or named colors to
components. Palette values belong in the theme definitions in `main.css` and
[themes.ts](../app/utils/themes.ts); themes can override the state colors too.
Examples: `.menu button:active` uses `--surface-2`, `.task-chip` uses `--line`,
and `.card-state.working` uses `--working`.

## Agent and pane state

Use the small square indicator, never a circle, rounded dot or circular status
icon. Reuse `.card-state i` or `.pill i`, as in
[AgentCard.vue](../app/components/AgentCard.vue) and
[AgentView.vue](../app/components/AgentView.vue). Their base size is **7 × 7 px**.
Keep the label alongside the indicator so color is not the only signal.

| State | Theme token | Shape and behavior | Source example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ready (`idle` in CSS) | `--idle` (green by default) | Hollow square, inset outline | `.card-state.idle i`, `.pill.idle i` |
| Working | `--working` (purple by default) | Filled square, 1.3 s pulse | `.card-state.working i`, `.pill.working i` |
| Blocked | `--blocked` (orange by default) | Filled square, 0.9 s pulse | `.card-state.blocked i`, `.pill.blocked i` |
| Done | `--done` (green by default) | Filled square | `.card-state.done`, `.pill.done` |
| Inactive | `--muted` | Hollow square | `.pill.inactive i` |
| Unknown / shell (card dot only: on the home, no status counts as Ready) | `--dim` | Filled square | `.card-state.unknown`, `.card-state.shell`, `.pill.unknown`, `.pill.shell` |

Preserve the existing deliberate size variations rather than copying them into a
new status system: `.card-state.blocked i` is 8 px; compact home lead indicators
are 9 px (10 px when blocked) under `.card.compact.home-lead`. The shape remains
square. The color names above describe the default Titanium palette, not fixed
colors to impose on other themes.

## Loading states

Never show a default as if it were the value: while a section's data loads, an
off switch or an empty list would read as real. Show skeletons instead, with
[SettingsSkeleton.vue](../app/components/SettingsSkeleton.vue): muted square
blocks at the size of what comes (rows of a settings card, a switch), a gentle
pulse that stops under `prefers-reduced-motion`, and the buttons that need the
data disabled. A failed load shows its error and *Try again*, never the
defaults. Example: [ProjectsSettings.vue](../app/components/ProjectsSettings.vue).

## Icons and buttons

Use Lucide icons (`i-lucide-*`) for interface actions. Reuse the icon already used
for the same action; search existing components before choosing one.

| Action | Icon | Existing example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Send | `i-lucide-arrow-up` | `UChatPromptSubmit` in [Composer.vue](../app/components/Composer.vue) (Nuxt UI submit icon) |
| Back | `i-lucide-chevron-left` | [AgentView.vue](../app/components/AgentView.vue), `.back` |
| More / options | `i-lucide-ellipsis` | [SpaceMenu.vue](../app/components/SpaceMenu.vue), `.space-menu` |

Agent branding and the existing `i-herdr-stop` glyph in `Composer.vue` are not
alternative action icon libraries to extend.

Buttons have square corners: no circular or pill-shaped buttons. Use existing
Nuxt UI controls with the app's classes, such as `.mono-btn`, `.icon-btn` and
`.task-sheet-actions > button`, rather than introducing a new button style.

Every touch target must be at least **44 × 44 px**. The drawn control can be
smaller if its actual hit area reaches that minimum. Example: `.prompt-send` is
32 px with `::after { inset: -8px }`, producing a 48 px hit area. Reserve space
for the expanded target: it must not overlap a neighbor's hit area. Coarse-pointer
`.icon-btn` controls are 44 × 44 px; `.hw-sheet-handle` draws a small bar within
a 44 px-high button. Check hit geometry, not just the visible icon.

## Phone headers and sheets

Phone header bars must be **44 px high**, excluding safe-area insets. Build around
the existing 44 px `.icon-btn` controls and `.agent-top` structure; do not add
padding that unnecessarily increases the bar height. These selectors are the
integration points, not evidence that every current header already meets this rule.

Reuse [AppSheet.vue](../app/components/AppSheet.vue) for drawers and sheets:
outside tap and downward swipe close a phone sheet; the handle also supports tap,
and Escape closes the modal. On open, focus goes to the sheet itself (no outline),
not to its handle or first button; Tab reaches the buttons, which keep their
keyboard focus ring. **Do not add a cross close button to sheets.**
The gesture implementation is `dragStart` / `dragMove` / `dragEnd`, with the
`.hw-sheet-handle` target. Current implementation gap: `AppSheet` still renders
`.hw-sheet-close` with `i-lucide-x`; this is not a pattern to copy. Full-screen
`screen` views disable sheet dragging, so retain an explicit navigation action
when using that mode.

Sheets and settings pages never scroll sideways, and have **one vertical
scroll**, the sheet's body: a tab's content takes its natural height, with no
inner scroll box. That scroll ends at the sheet's bottom edge: the gap under
the last element and the phone's home bar room are padding inside it
(`--sheet-end` on `.hw-sheet`, on the footer when the sheet has one), never a
band under the scrolled content; a sheet's own content adds no bottom padding.
A bar pinned at the bottom of the scroll (`position: sticky; bottom: 0`, a
task's To do buttons on the phone, the folder picker's buttons) is the body's
last element and carries that padding itself; the body then has none, so the
bar sits on the sheet's edge and nothing scrolls under it.
What could overflow shrinks, wraps or is ellipsized: grid
and flex children get `min-width: 0` (`minmax(0, 1fr)` tracks), long names and
paths wrap with `overflow-wrap: anywhere`, fields are `w-full` or
`min(100%, …)`. The one exception is a row meant to be swiped (the phone's row
of screenshots in a task's To do). Scrollbars are the app's, set once in
[main.css](../app/assets/css/main.css): thin, in the theme's line color, never
the browser default; a strip of chips may hide its bar instead. On a computer
the project and task sheets are 920 px wide. The check is
[core-sheets.spec.ts](../tests/e2e/core-sheets.spec.ts).

Reuse [MenuSheet.vue](../app/components/MenuSheet.vue), `.menu`, `.menu-group`,
`.menu-sep` and `.menu-note` for action lists and grouped menus. Use
[SpaceMenu.vue](../app/components/SpaceMenu.vue) as the example of a menu that
adapts between phone sheets and desktop dropdowns. Avoid parallel sheet or menu
implementations.

## Text and layout checks

Follow [Contributing: Conventions](../CONTRIBUTING.md#conventions) for English
only interface text and `t()` / `tl()` usage; French translations are optional. Do not duplicate
those translation rules here. Examples: the translated Send label in
[Composer.vue](../app/components/Composer.vue) and Back in
[AgentView.vue](../app/components/AgentView.vue).

For every interface change, inspect the layout on an iPhone-sized phone and a
computer (iPhone 13 and 1440 × 900 are the repository's screenshot sizes). Check
text wrapping, header height, touch targets and their neighbors, menu and sheet
dismissal, scrolling, keyboard and safe areas. Use the existing responsive
`.agent-top` and `.hw-sheet.screen` styles as integration examples. Follow the
[device guide](devices.md) and the [iOS convention](../CONTRIBUTING.md#conventions);
use the isolated demo screenshot workflow in
[Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md#the-browser-demo) for visual evidence.

**Nothing scrolls sideways: a sheet's or a page's content never exceeds its
width.** Use no negative horizontal margin (`margin-left`, `margin-right`, a
shorthand's sides, Tailwind `-mx-*`): to align an icon or a swatch inside a
larger touch target, place it inside with padding or `justify-items: start`.
One stays only when its parent clips (`overflow: hidden`) or has at least that
much padding, and its line then says why: `/* overflow-safe: <why> */`.
[tests/negativeMargins.test.ts](../tests/negativeMargins.test.ts) fails on any
other in `app/`.
